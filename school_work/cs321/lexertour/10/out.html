One of the difficulties of using English to document technical details
(such as the descriptions of various forms of textual patterns in this
question) is that the use of natural language frequently results in
ambiguous, or incomplete specifications.  One of the purposes of this
exercise, even though it will likely result in some frustration, is to
reinforce that point!  One of the purposes of distributing this test
file is to reduce that frustration by giving you some concrtete examples
that you can use to test your program.  That said, this file doesn't
test all possibilities either, so you are strongly encouraged to test
your solution with examples other than the ones shown here.
Nevertheless, if your program produces the same output for this input
file as the sample solution, then your solution is probably in good
shape ...

Be warned that what follows is really just a collection of examples
and test cases collected together in a sample file; it isn't meant to
be read as a coherent document in its own right.


Examples using times written in 12 hour formats:
------------------------------------------------
The question mentions times like <a href="clock://12:30 ">12:30 </a>or <a href="clock://4:59pm">4:59pm</a> that should be matched.
You might want to try some additional simple examples of this kind!

We might also try some variants with different am/pm  suffixes.  (Of
course, the am/pm parts shouldn't match when they appear without a
time.)

    <a href="clock://12:00pm">12:00pm</a>   <a href="clock://12:01am">12:01am</a>
    <a href="clock://12:02p.m.">12:02p.m.</a> <a href="clock://12:03a.m.">12:03a.m.</a>
    <a href="clock://12:01">12:01</a>.am  <a href="clock://12:03">12:03</a>abmn

How about some examples with mixed upper and lower case?  Maybe some odd
looking things like the following:

    <a href="clock://11:00pm">11:00pm</a> <a href="clock://11:01Pm">11:01Pm</a> <a href="clock://11:02pM">11:02pM</a> <a href="clock://11:03PM">11:03PM</a>

Now we might begin to wonder if it was a good idea to allow for mixtures
of upper and lower case.  But if that's what the customer wants ... :-)

And what if there are spaces between the number and the suffix?  Maybe
even multiple spaces and tabs, etc.?

<a href="clock://10:15 am">10:15 am</a>, <a href="clock://10:16 PM">10:16 PM</a>, <a href="clock://10:17 a.m.">10:17 a.m.</a>, <a href="clock://10:18
pm">10:18
pm</a>, <a href="clock://3:45    am">3:45    am</a>; <a href="clock://2:15    p.m.">2:15    p.m.</a>;  <a href="clock://7:19 ">7:19 </a>bcd; <a href="clock://12:00

am">12:00

am</a>. etc...

The question says that no part of the following strings should be
matched because these strings do not correspond to valid times:
  16:9   4:3  1:100   1:60   25:00

Adding spaces there shouldn't make a difference either:
  16 : 9   4 : 3  1 : 100   1 : 60   25 : 00

Even if we change to numbers in the correct range, the results still
shouldn't be matched:

  10 : 19  4 : 30  1 : 10  1: 59  2 :50

But if we remove some of those spaces ...

  <a href="clock://10:19  ">10:19  </a><a href="clock://4:30  ">4:30  </a><a href="clock://1:10  ">1:10  </a><a href="clock://1:59  ">1:59  </a><a href="clock://2:50

">2:50

</a>Ok, enough!  Let's try something new ... 


Examples using times written in 24 hour formats:
------------------------------------------------
This time, the question mentions valid times like <a href="clock://1230 ">1230 </a>and <a href="clock://1659">1659</a>, so we
had better accept those.  But we shouldn't be matching any part of a
numeric value like 123, 3206, or 12345 because those strings of numbers
do not meet the constraints that we need for a valid 24 hour time
string.  (Did somebody say 24:00 hours?  Or was that <a href="clock://0:00">0:00</a>?)

That doesn't look like a lot of test cases; you might want to try a few
more to make sure your solution is working ...


Examples of email addresses:
----------------------------
To quote from the question:

  Thus <a href="mailto://samuel@pdx.edu">samuel@pdx.edu</a>, samantha@project.cs.pdx.edu, and
  sam+<a href="mailto://sam@our_home-domain.com">sam@our_home-domain.com</a> are valid email addresses, but no part of
  sammy@a.b.c.d.e and _<a href="mailto://samma@thesams.net">samma@thesams.net</a> will be matched.

Except that, as noted in one of the D2L discussion forums, the last
example is actually valid (because underscores are included in the set
of characters that can be used in an email name) and so it will (or at
least should) be matched after all.

If you read the description in the question carefully, there are some
other properties of solutions that you'll probably want to test.  For
example, do we allow periods in the name portion of an email, but
prohibit exclamation marks?

   <a href="http://ho.hum">ho.hum</a>@<a href="http://pdx.edu">pdx.edu</a>
   yes!no!@<a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>
   maybe!<a href="mailto://ornot@woogle.com">ornot@woogle.com</a>

It would appear so (if you get the same results as me) ...  But don't
forget to check your solution against the other properties listed in the
question ...


Website addresses:
------------------
Here are some examples from the question, with a few extras thrown in
for good measure:

   Should match:
     "<a href="http://pdx.edu">pdx.edu</a>"
     "<a href="http://cs.pdx.edu">http://cs.pdx.edu</a>"
     "<a href="https://google.com">https://google.com</a>"
     "<a href="http://a.com">a.com</a>"
     "<a href="http://a.b.com">a.b.com</a>"
     "<a href="http://a.b.c.com">a.b.c.com</a>"
     "<a href="http://pdx.edu/sample/solutions">http://pdx.edu/sample/solutions</a>"
     "<a href="http://w.w.com/a/">w.w.com/a/</a>"

   Should not match:
     "http://"           (missing domain)
     "https://"          (missing domain)
     "http:///pdx.edu"   (too many slashes)
     "a.b.c.d.e"         (too many components)
     "nothttp://foo.bar" (invalid prefix)

   Let's try some of these without the quotes, just in case:
     <a href="http://pdx.edu">pdx.edu</a>, <a href="http://cs.pdx.edu">http://cs.pdx.edu</a>, <a href="http://a.com">a.com</a>, <a href="http://a.b.c.com">a.b.c.com</a>
     <a href="http://pdx.edu/sample/solutions">http://pdx.edu/sample/solutions</a>, <a href="http://w.w.com/a/">w.w.com/a/</a>
     https://, http:///pdx.edu, a.b.c.d.e, nothttp://foo.bar

Notice that following the description in the question will give us the
match we expect for a sentence like "Go to <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>.", highlighting a
domain name followed by a period.  On the other hand, you might like to
advise your customer that this behavior will give the wrong treatment
for abbreviations like <a href="http://i.e">i.e</a>., <a href="http://e.g">e.g</a>., or <a href="http://a.k.a">a.k.a</a>.  Perhaps they will want to
revise their specification to address cases like this in a different
way, and to recognize your observation of this special case with an
appropriate bonus when they pay your invoice :-)


Internet protocol addresses:
----------------------------
According to the question, "<a href="ping://192.168.0.1">192.168.0.1</a>", "<a href="ping://192.168.0.001">192.168.0.001</a>", and
"<a href="ping://131.23.45.12">131.23.45.12</a>" should be treated as valid IPv4 addresses, but no part of
"1.2", "1.2.3.4.1", "1.256.7.8" and "1.1000.65.34" should be matched.

(Note that 1.1030.203.10 does not produce any matches, despite the fact
that it includes something that would match the 24 hour time format,
specifically "<a href="clock://1030">1030</a>" ... and that latter one should have matched!)

<a href="http://P.S">P.S</a>.  Just a quick reminder that you'll still need to do the right
thing with any &lt;, &gt;, or &amp; symbols that appear in the input.  But
it is easier to do that for AutoLight than it was for MiniColor!
